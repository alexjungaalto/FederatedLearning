# Title: Federated Learning Systems: taking the training to the data with Flower

**Abstract.** This lecture will be divided into three parts: first, we will 
introduce the opportunities that FL brings compared to traditional centralised 
training; second, we will cover the main challenges, from the systems and ML 
perspective, that arise when deploying and running FL workloads; finally, and 
after an introduction of the key components of the Flower framework, we will 
go through three FL projects of increasing sophistication. Critically, we will 
see how the same FL client workload can transparently be executed in devices 
such as your personal computer, a Raspberry Pi, or a multi-node GPU cluster 
by means of Flowerâ€™s Simulation Engine. By the end of this lecture you will 
have all the tools needed to design and execute your own FL projects with Flower.

**Speaker.** Javier Fernandez-Marques is a research scientist at Flower Labs. 
He works on the core framework and develops the Flower Simulation Engine, 
which allows to run Federated Learning workloads in a resource-aware manner 
and scale these to thousands of active clients. Javier interests lie in the 
intersection of Machine Learning and Systems, and more concretely running 
on-device ML workloads, a key component in Federated Learning. He often 
writes about running ML on embedded devices such as RaspberryPi or NVIDIA 
Jetsons. Javier got his PhD in Computer Science from the University of 
Oxford in 2021. Before joining Flower Labs, he worked as a research scientist 
at Samsung AI (Cambridge, UK)
