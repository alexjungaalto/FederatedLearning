**Title.** Anonymization in data processing and publishing

**Abstract.** Big data have opened new opportunities to collect, store, process and, most of all, 
monetize data. This has created tension with privacy, especially when it comes to information 
about individuals. Privacy-preserving data processing allows companies, researchers and 
practitioners to share datasets carrying significant value while preserving at the same time 
the privacy of users. Researchers proposed approaches for anonymization like generalizing 
or removing data from the most sensitive fields.  I will present the basic concepts of privacy-preserving 
data processing, introducing the main motivations, challenges and opportunities around 
anonymization techniques. I will focus on k-anonymity as the classical approach to anonymize 
tabular data, and differential privacy as a flexible technique for running privacy-preserving queries.

**Speaker.** Luca Vassio is an Assistant Professor in the field of Computer Engineering at Politecnico di 
Torino (Italy) and a member of SmartData@Polito research center for Big Data technologies. He holds 
a PhD 'cum laude' in Communication Engineering and an MSc in Mathematical Engineering. In the last 
few years, he has worked and visited Bell Labs, MIT, UFMG, and Huawei. His research interests include 
big data analysis, machine learning and complex networks. He applies these techniques to cybersecurity 
problems, online social networks, and intelligent transport systems.
