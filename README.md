## Abstract

Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized approach to training machine learning models, 
designed to retain local data privacy by training models without centralizing datasets. 
This course covers the fundamental linear algebra and calculus needed to analyze and design 
FL systems, focusing on real-world applications like weather forecasting and healthcare.

Participants will learn:
- to formulate FL applications as optimization problems
- to design FL algorithms using distributed optimization  
- about key requirements for trustworthy AI
- to critically evaluate the trustworthiness of FL systems
