# CS-E4740 — Federated Learning  
*Spring 2025 · Aalto University*

This is the official GitHub material repository for course **CS-E4740 Federated Learning**, a Master's level course 
offered at Aalto University. The repository contains selected course material, including code examples, assignments, 
and lecture notes—most notably the Springer textbook *Federated Learning: From Theory to Practice*.

## Course Overview

**Federated Learning (FL)** is a privacy-preserving, decentralized paradigm for training machine learning models 
without sharing raw data. This course provides a mathematical and practical introduction to FL, combining elements 
of optimization, machine learning, and systems design.

**Key topics include:**

- Formulating FL applications as optimization problems  
- Designing algorithms using distributed and federated optimization  
- Understanding and implementing requirements for **trustworthy AI**  
- Evaluating privacy, robustness, and fairness in FL systems

Applications discussed include domains such as **weather forecasting** and **personalized healthcare**.
