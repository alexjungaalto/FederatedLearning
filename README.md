# 📡 Federated Learning – CS-E4740 (Spring 2025, Aalto University)

Welcome to the GitHub repository for **CS-E4740 - Federated Learning**, a master-level course offered every spring at **Aalto University**. 
This course introduces the foundations and applications of **Federated Learning (FL)**—a privacy-preserving and decentralized 
approach to training machine learning models on distributed data.

> 📘 Lecture notes are published as a Springer textbook:  
> **Alexander Jung, _Federated Learning: From Theory to Practice_ (Springer, 2025)**, [arxiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19183)
